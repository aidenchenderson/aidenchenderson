## Hey, I'm Aiden!
I'm an honours computer science student at McMaster University. 
<br><br> University has helped me hone my skills in fundamental computer science areas like computer architecture, data structures & algorithms, and software development. I am also challenging myself academically by taking advanced courses in linear algebra to learn more about linear programming and computer graphics.

### 🤔 About me
Outside of school I enjoy going to the gym, biking, and hanging out with my cats.

### 💻 Tech Stack
Listed here are the programming languages I am most familiar with and some of their related technology; I've separated the related ones into rows. I'm also experienced in Java but couldn't find an image for it. 😅
